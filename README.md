KnightVision â€” Explore chess at scale with data-driven insights and move analysis.

**KnightVision** is a Python project designed to analyze chess games at scale, transforming raw PGN data into structured insights. As a chess enthusiast, I wanted to build a project that combines my passion for the game with data-driven analysis.  

KnightVision enables parsing of large game datasets, extracting key information such as openings, player ratings, results, and move sequences. This structured data can then be used for statistical exploration, visualization of trends, and advanced analyses like identifying common mistakes or predicting outcomes.  

The project demonstrates the application of programming, data processing, and analytical skills in a domain I enjoy.
